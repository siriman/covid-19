# COVID-19 Spread Prediction
The main objective of this study is to predict the cumulative number of cases of the disease based on historical data. Its exploitation will be purely for statistical results intended for the governors. The data is reliable and in no case will objectivity be shaken in this prediction and can serve as a very good basis for decision-makers.
We will use time series with Holt's reading method which we modify by adding a logarithm function as input for good modeling of the starting values.
